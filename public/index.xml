      <description>Introduction Bun created quite a buzz late last year when v1.0 was released. Unlike NodeJS which uses the V8 engine, Bun uses the JavaScriptCore framework which was created by Apple. The framework is written in C++ and is used in Safari and other Apple products. It&amp;rsquo;s an all in-one bundler, package manager and runtime, potentially replacing NodeJS.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a graph breaking down the performance benchmarks of Bun vs Node vs Deno:</description>

      <description>Ever since I was little, I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated by technology. Watching my father fix thrown-away electronics around the house, I was mesmerized by circuit boards, which looked like tiny cities to me. By the time I was 13, I was creating &amp;ldquo;flash&amp;rdquo; video games using ActionScript and Macromedia. After high school, I got an internship where I learned to manage Linux servers on old computers. After my internship ended, life was tough, I had hardly anything and finding a job was challenging.</description>

      <description>Superb
Superb is a comprehensive web application that allows users to create and manage their work schedules. I worked with the founder and CTO to develop the application&amp;rsquo;s MVP. I designed the database schema, architected the backend, and developed on the frontend with a small team.
Dayton Truck Tires
I helped architect and develop this website for Dayon Truck Tires on the Adobe AEM platform, and components using a Java backend.</description>

      <title>Authentication Issues in Safari and iOS Browsers</title>

      <description>The Problem: I recently came across a time-consuming bug on a fresh application build. The issue, authentication operated perfectly on Chrome (Desktop), yet authentication was completely broken on Chrome/iOS. This issue was compounded by the fact that the issue was not limited to Chrome, but also affected Firefox and Safari on iOS.
The problem wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear to me at first: Authentication, which performed as expected in Chrome on desktop environments was not working on iOS at all in any browser.</description>
