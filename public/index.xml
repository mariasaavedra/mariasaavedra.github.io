      <description>Introduction Bun created quite a buzz late last year when v1.0 was released. Unlike NodeJS which uses the V8 engine, Bun uses the JavaScriptCore framework which was created by Apple. The framework is written in C++ and is used in Safari and other Apple products. It&amp;rsquo;s an all in-one bundler, package manager and runtime, potentially replacing NodeJS.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a graph breaking down the performance benchmarks of Bun vs Node vs Deno:</description>

      <description>Maria Saavedra demonstrated an early affinity for the intricate workings of technology. This interest was kindled by observing her father skillfully repair electronic devices, which cultivated in Maria a deep fascination with circuit boards, perceived by her as microcosms of cities.
Early Ventures into Technology By the age of 8, Maria had ventured into developing video games. After high school, she commenced with a technology internship, where she adeptly managed Linux servers on repurposed computers.</description>

      <description>Superb
Superb is a comprehensive web application that allows users to create and manage their work schedules. I worked with the founder and CTO to develop the application&amp;rsquo;s MVP. I designed the database schema, architected the backend, and developed on the frontend with a small team.
Dayton Truck Tires
I helped architect and develop this website for Dayon Truck Tires on the Adobe AEM platform, and components using a Java backend.</description>

      <title>Authentication Issues in Safari and iOS Browsers</title>

      <description>The Problem: I recently came across a time-consuming bug on a fresh application build. The issue, authentication operated perfectly on Chrome (Desktop), yet authentication was completely broken on Chrome/iOS. This issue was compounded by the fact that the issue was not limited to Chrome, but also affected Firefox and Safari on iOS.
The problem wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear to me at first: Authentication, which performed as expected in Chrome on desktop environments was not working on iOS at all in any browser.</description>
