      <description>Introduction Bun created quite a buzz late last year when v1.0 was released. Unlike NodeJS which uses the V8 engine, Bun uses the JavaScriptCore framework which was created by Apple. The framework is written in C++ and is used in Safari and other Apple products. It&amp;rsquo;s an all in-one bundler, package manager and runtime, potentially replacing NodeJS.

      <description>The Problem: I recently came across a time-consuming bug on a fresh application build. The issue, authentication operated perfectly on Chrome (Desktop), yet authentication was completely broken on Chrome/iOS. This issue was compounded by the fact that the issue was not limited to Chrome, but also affected Firefox and Safari on iOS.
The problem wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear to me at first: Authentication, which performed as expected in Chrome on desktop environments was not working on iOS at all in any browser.</description>
