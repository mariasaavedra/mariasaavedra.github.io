The issue, authentication operated perfectly on Chrome (Desktop), yet authentication was completely broken on Chrome/iOS. This issue was compounded by the fact that the issue was not limited to Chrome, but also affected Firefox and Safari on iOS.
The problem wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear to me at first: Authentication, which performed as expected in Chrome on desktop environments was not working on iOS at all in any browser.</description></item></channel></rss>
