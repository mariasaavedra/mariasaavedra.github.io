			<p>Ever since I was little, I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by technology. Watching my father fix thrown-away electronics around the house, I was mesmerized by circuit boards, which looked like tiny cities to me. By the time I was 13, I was creating &ldquo;flash&rdquo; video games using ActionScript and Macromedia. After high school, I got an internship where I learned to manage Linux servers on old computers. After my internship ended, life was tough, I had hardly anything and finding a job was challenging. But I didn&rsquo;t give up. I taught myself how to develop software. By the time I was 18, I landed a job as a Software Engineer.</p>
<p>As of August 2023, I&rsquo;m the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Clintuition, we&rsquo;re leveraging AI technology with realistic medical scenarios to transform clinical practice.
Since June 2020, I&rsquo;ve been volunteering my technical expertise at WeCode KC. I lead a team of volunteers and create coding programs for kids who don&rsquo;t usually get these opportunities. I love helping the community and encouraging young tech talents.</p>
<p>I also started my own company, M7 STUDIO, in July 2022. We&rsquo;re based in Kansas City and we focus on developing prototypes to help startup founders materialize their ideas and grow their companies.</p>
