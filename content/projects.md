1. [Superb](https://superbshifts.com/)

   Superb is a comprehensive web application that allows users to create and manage their work schedules. I worked with the founder and CTO to develop the application's MVP. I designed the database schema, architected the backend, and developed on the frontend with a small team.

3. [Dayton Truck Tires](https://commercial.bridgestone.com/en-us/truck-and-bus/tires)

   I helped architect and develop this website for Dayon Truck Tires on the Adobe AEM platform, and components using a Java backend. I ensured code was cross-browser/platform/OS compatible. I led Style Guide development and implementation. I also led the development of the Dealer Locator feature, which used the Google Maps API.

   Another project I worked on at VMLY&R was the Bridgestone Commercial website. I worked on the frontend of this project, which was built on the Adobe AEM platform. I ensured code was cross-browser/platform/OS compatible.
