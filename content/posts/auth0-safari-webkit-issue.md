## Introduction

I recently encountered a problem with authentication in Safari that consumed a considerable amount of my time. Looking back, the solution was simple, though it wasn't immediately apparent to me. While Auth0 operated without a hitch on Chrome (Desktop), it encountered difficulties on mobile browsers, notably on iOS. However, doing most of my development on Chrome and emulating browsers via Dev Tools, I was unaware of this issue until it was brought to my attention by a colleague.

### The Problem: Inconsistent Authentication

The problem wasn't clear to me at first: Authentication, which performed as expected in Chrome on desktop environments was not working on iOS at all. This disparity was not just perplexing but also a source of frustration as this issue was not caught earler in the development process.

### Understanding Safari's Intelligent Tracking Prevention & iOS Webkit

The key to unraveling this mystery lay in understanding a critical feature of the Safari browser—Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP). Recent versions of Safari have introduced ITP as a default feature, fundamentally altering how cookies and tracking mechanisms operate. ITP, by design, aims to enhance user privacy by preventing cross-site tracking.

To confirm if ITP was the culprit, one can navigate to Safari's Preferences, access the Privacy tab, and check for the 'Prevent cross-site tracking' option. If this option is active, which is the default setting. !

For more information on how to access Safari's Preferences and disable cross-site tracking, you can refer to the [official Apple support guide](https://support.apple.com/lv-lv/guide/safari/sfri40732/mac).

After disabling this option, Auth0 authentication worked as expected. Voila! The revelation was clear: Safari's ITP was blocking the cookies essential for Auth0's session management.

The discovery was twofold: not only was Safari's ITP blocking essential cookies for Auth0's session management, but another quirk compounded the issue. All browsers on iOS, regardless of the brand, utilize the Webkit engine—this includes Chrome and Firefox on iOS. This means that the ITP settings affect all these browsers, not just Safari. The result was a broader impact than initially perceived, affecting user authentication across all iOS browsers.

Apple is considering dropping this requirement, as reported by [9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2023/02/07/new-iphone-browsers/).

## The Solution:

Faced with this challenge, two solutions presented themselves: restructuring our session management to be server-side or adopting Auth0's custom domain feature. The former, while viable, implied a considerable overhaul of our backend architecture.

### Choosing the Custom Domain

After thorough deliberation, I opted for Auth0's custom domain feature. This solution, although accompanied by a $23/month cost, promised an instant resolution.

Implementing the custom domain was a straightforward affair. The impact was immediate and positive—Auth0 authentication became consistent and reliable across all browsers, including the problematic Safari and mobile iOS browsers.

## Reflections

This experience highlighted the importance of understanding browser-specific behaviors, particularly when dealing with security and authentication. Emulating devices via Developer Tools is a useful tool for testing, but it is not a substitute for real-world testing, had we tested our application on an actual iOS device, we would have caught this issue much earlier in the development process.
