Ever since I was little, I've been fascinated by technology. Watching my dad fix electronics around the house, I was mesmerized by circuit boards, which looked like tiny cities to me. By the time I was 13, I was creating "flash" video games using ActionScript and Macromedia. After high school, I got an internship where I learned to manage Linux servers on old computers. After my internship ended, life was tough, I had hardly anything and finding a job was challenging. But I didn't give up. I taught myself how to develop software. By the time I was 18, I landed a job as a Software Engineer.

As of August 2023, I'm the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Clintuition, we're leveraging AI technology with realistic medical scenarios to transform clinical practice.
Since June 2020, I've been volunteering my technical expertise at WeCode KC. I lead a team of volunteers and create coding programs for kids who don't usually get these opportunities. I love helping the community and encouraging young tech talents.

I also started my own company, M7 STUDIO, in July 2022. We're based in Kansas City and we focus on developing prototypes to help startup founders materialize their ideas and grow their companies.
